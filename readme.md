# Real-time human pose estimation, powered by YOLOv8

This project is dedicated to applying computer vision to deliver a dependable and efficient solution for human pose recognition using a state-of-the-art object detection and image segmentation model - YOLOv8.

## Requirements
First, we use PyTorch(CPU)
see more on the PyTorch site: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

```Python
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```
Then, we need to install ultralytics for the YOLOv8 pose estimation

```Python
pip install ultralytics
```

This project is under development!
